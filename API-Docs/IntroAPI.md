Try-Lingual is an app that seeks to aid in the learning of a foreign language by quizing users on a selection of vocab words. To ensure that each user will have a unique experience that is tailored to their needs the concept of spaced repetition was placed at the forefront of design and implementation decisions.

 Spaced repetition seeks to mitigate information decay and encourage retention by encourages learners to undergoe quizzes at increasing intervals if they ansefser questions correctly and reseting those intervals when the learner answers incorrectly. The key is that only questions answered correctly have an increaesed interval between susequent times to study and quiz,while those answered incrrectly are designated for immediate re-study and re-evaluation.
